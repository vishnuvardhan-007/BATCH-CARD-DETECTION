# Batch Card Detection App

This repository hosts a deep learning-powered solution to detect the presence of a batch card on a person using images. Built with **TensorFlow** and deployed using **Streamlit**, this app provides accurate predictions and a user-friendly interface.

## Features:
- Detects whether a person is wearing a batch card.
- Trained on custom-labeled datasets for high accuracy.
- Intuitive Streamlit-based user interface.
- Easily customizable and extendable.

## Demo
Upload an image to check if a batch card is detected:

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:

## How It Works

1. **Model Training**: 
   The model was trained using TensorFlow on a custom dataset with two classes:
   - `Batch Card Present`
   - `No Batch Card Detected`

2. **Inference**: 
   The app preprocesses the uploaded image and uses the trained model to predict the presence of a batch card.

3. **Streamlit UI**: 
   Provides an intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
